\section{Metrics}%
\label{sec:metrics}
Before we can test the environmental impact of CI/CD practices, we need to define the metrics that will be used to measure this impact. The metrics will be used to evaluate the environmental impact of CI/CD practices and to compare the sustainability of different CI/CD practices. The metrics will be used to measure the energy consumption, carbon footprint, and resource utilization of CI/CD practices. The metrics will also be used to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of CI/CD practices.

The metrics that will be used to measure the environmental impact of CI/CD practices are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CPU Usage
    \item Memory Usage
    \item Build Metrics
    \item Resource Utilization
    \item System Uptime
\end{itemize}


\section{Tools}%
\label{sec:tools}
The tool for the measurement of the metrics is Prometheus. We will use Prometheus to collect the data and Grafana to visualize the data. The data will be collected from the CI/CD pipeline.
